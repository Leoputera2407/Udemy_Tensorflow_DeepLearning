# Udemy TensorFlow

This course really goes into the basics of machin learning. There are
a lot of guidance in the project, making the projects very approachable
especially as a beginner. 

In this course, I learnt how to use the TensorFlow API and did a few cool projects:
To name a few, we implemented an:
 1. MNIST handwritten number classifier
 2. California household income classification from census data
 3. Training a dummy to run using Reinforcement Learning

 Topics we cover are:
 1. CNN
 2. Auto-endcoders
 3. GAN
 4. Reinforcement Learning
